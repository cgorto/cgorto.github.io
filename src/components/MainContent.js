              <h2>Sustainable Menstruation - A Period Piece:</h2>
            <p>
                Pads and tampons are products found all over the world, especially in landfills. Their single-use nature, combined with their questionable ingredients, should make those who experience menstruation think twice about what products they use. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The average menstruator will use <a href='https://www.ahpma.co.uk/menstruation_facts_and_figures/'>11,000</a> period products in their lifetime. These 11,000 single-use products can sit in a landfill for <a href='https://www.webmd.com/women/what-to-know-about-disposing-of-used-tampons'>500-800 years</a>. Traditional menstruation products, such as tampons and pads, are made of plastic and therefore cannot be composted. 
            </p>
            <p>
            On top of being bad for the environment, these products can also be bad for the user’s body. According to a public <a href='https://womensvoices.org/2024/02/22/period-product-101-90-min-webinar/'>webinar</a> hosted by Women’s Voices for the Earth this past February, companies often use what could be considered pointless additives like silver ions for anti-odor and titanium dioxide for whitening, that are dangerous to the body and are unnecessary. 
            </p>
            <p>Silver ions, for example, are added to period products to prevent bacteria or odor. However, silver is toxic to vaginal tissue and to healthy vaginal bacteria like lactobacillus. 
            </p>
            <p>Executive Director of Science and Research Alexandra Scranton explained that, “adding silver has never been proven to make any difference you know to smell or to odor. It's really just a marketing gimmick that's kind of preying on this irrational fear of period odor so you're fine and you smell beautiful. We don't need toxic silver in these products.”</p>
            <p>Sharra Vostral who is the Assistant Dean of Research in the School of Communication at Northwestern University, a historian, and author of Toxic Shock: a Social History, explained that because the vagina is delicate. The skin is moist and the canal is absorptive, making it easier for the intake of chemicals. To combat this, Vostral recommended organic products but does understand that there are barriers. </p>
            <p>“I do think organic is better, but you can't always get organic or you can't always afford organic.”</p>
            <p>Some sustainable menstrual products can also help avoid chemicals. Menstrual cups, for example, are typically made out of medical-grade silicon. In a clear or white appearing cup, this may be the only ingredient. Any other color is subject to dyes. </p>
            <p>Vostral stated that, “I think it's worth it to try the menstrual cups and they work wonderfully for a lot of people and some people they just don't.”</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, sustainable menstrual products do have barriers like cost. Reusable period underwear can cost upwards of thirty dollars a pair, depending on the brand. </p>
            <p><a href='https://thejunecup.com/collections/frontpage'>JUNE</a>, however, is an example of companies doing things right.</p>
            <p>To ensure people have access to safe, sustainable, and affordable menstrual products, they only charge production costs for their menstrual cups. They also sanitize kits. </p>
            <p>Access to proper sanitation can also be a barrier to sustainable period care. Menstrual cups can be messy and need to be properly sanitized. Public restrooms aren’t the best place for changing these, as they need to be dumped and cleaned periodically.</p>
            <p>
Access to water is also important. At home, menstrual cups can be washed in boiling water. Period underwear should be rinsed and washed in cold water in the washing machine, but not everyone has access to clean water or washers to keep these products properly sanitized.</p>
<p> Ingredients, waste , and sanitation are all important aspects of selecting the right menstrual products. Picking what's healthy, comfortable, and affordable as an indivial is also imperative.</p>
