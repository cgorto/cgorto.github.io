              <p>Frank was met with backlash from various demographics. as she conducted this research. She was met with resistance from trans people in academia stating asking trans and nonbinary individuals about menstruation would be rude and dysphoric. At a conference, someone came up to her and told her that she had stolen menstruation from women. She was also ridiculed for doing the research when she is not transgender or nonbinary. </p>
              <p>She also experienced misogyny when trying to publish.</p>
              <p>“[Her publisher] actually originally rejected my article,” she explained. “It was like a guest editing situation, and they rejected articles that were about to do with female bodies.”</p>
              <p>Her regular editor would later ask why she didn’t send in her article and tell her they would have loved to have seen it.</p>
              <p>“I want to highlight that there is still a layered what I would call like a palimpsest there of transphobia, but like misogyny in the trans identity as well and that exists and it's hard. It's really hard.”</p>
