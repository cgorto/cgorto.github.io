              <h2>Gender and sustainability</h2>
              <p>Menstruation is widely seen as a “women’s” thing. However, not all women menstruate and not all who menstruate are women. To say this is something that only women or that all women experience is inaccurate, despite the gendered language that is frequently used surrounding periods and the products that are used when one is experiencing their period.  </p>
              <p>That being said, there is little research or attention on queer and trans individuals who might be assigned female at birth (AFAB), but no longer identify as a female but still menstruate. </p>
              <p>
Sarah “Frankie” Frank, Faculty Lecturer at University of Wisconsin - Madison, is the first person to look into queer menstruation from a research perspective. Her research focused on Trans and Non-Binary Menstruation and consisted of twenty-one formal interviews (find zines of the interview findings here.) </p>
              <p>Frank learned through these interviews that men’s bathrooms and periods do not go hand in hand and can be a prominent issue for people that use this restroom but menstruate. </p>
              <p>“I never asked anybody about bathroom usage, but every single person talked to me about that,” Frank explained.  </p>
              <p>Mens restrooms can be a source of discomfort and even fear for individuals who weren’t assigned male at birth (AMAB) when they experience a period. Men’s rooms don’t supply menstruation products like pads or tampons like most women’s restrooms do. Additionally, trans men may not feel safe opening the loud plastic wrapper in the men’s room, as it could out them as trans and put them in harms way. </p>
              <p>On one hand, something like period underwear could help with this issue by eliminating the need for single-use products. Thinx was one of the first brands to put out an ad with a boyshort style including a transgender man. Wearing something like Thinx period boyshorts prevents anything from making noise, however, Frank points out that this is not a one-size-fits-all all solution.</p>
              <p>“From what we know about the way that people use those products, they layer them up which means it potentially helps, but it's not a safety. It's not going to remedy safety constantly. All the time. So I think it could be helpful but it is not a like everything solved kind of thing”</p>
              <p>If menstruation catches the man off guard, as menstruation can do, then they may not be wearing their period underwear. Additionally, some people with heavier or more unpredictable flows may use underwear in conjunction with a tampon to prevent leakage and feel more secure. </p>
              <p>Noisy packaging isn’t the only design flaw acting against transgender men and nonbinary individuals in the period industry. Traditional, single-use products often have very feminine flowery branding. </p>
              <p>Frank does believe that brands are moving away from this, however it’s not to be more inclusive. </p>
              <p>“Women don't like that stuff either,” Frank explained, “women don't like flowery and for a long time disliked the menstrual products industry and the way it bows into claims of women dancing with these big skirts and Always having its slogan like ‘have a happy period’. Women and girls have been fighting against that for 50 years.” </p>
              <p>Frank acknowledged that change is on the horizon, but it’s more so because all the parties involved are encouraging change, and not necessarily to be gender inclusive. </p>
