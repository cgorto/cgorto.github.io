              <h2>Company Q&A with Desiree Gibbens from JUNE Co.</h2>
              <p>JUNE Co. is a company trying to give everyone affordable access to safe and sustainable menstruation products. They offer menstrual cups, discs, period underwear, cleaning solution, and starter kits. These products are available on their website. Their menstrual cups are sold at production costs and last for up to five years, making them a significantly cheaper option of $8 dollars or so compared to the $10 box 40 or so tampons, brand depending.</p>
              <p><span className="question">What sets you apart from other brands?</span></p>
              <p>The goal of The JUNE Co. is to provide individuals with a cost-effective and eco-friendly solution to pads and tampons by offering reusable menstrual cups. While leading brands such as Tampax, Kotex, and Always recognize the increasing demand for sustainable menstrual care, they primarily rely on single-use products to retain customers. However, Hedi Rappard, the founder of JUNE, capitalized on the opportunity during the global pandemic in 2020 and realized that other companies were persisting in selling products at exorbitant prices. However, June we opted to offer their menstrual cups at the production cost.</p>
              
              <p><span className="question">Why is sustainability important to your brand?</span></p>
              <p>JUNE's foundation rests upon the principles of safety, ease, and environmental responsibility. Advancing the well-being of our bodies, communities, and the Earth is paramount. The concept for the JUNE cup emerged from Rappard's quest for sustainable alternatives to address recurring menstrual discomfort. The company aims to offer menstrual care products devoid of harmful chemicals and toxins, ensuring accessibility without compromising on quality or affordability.</p>
              
              <p><span className="question">How important is gender inclusivity to your brand?</span></p>
              <p>Gender inclusivity is paramount to our brand. We believe that menstrual care is a fundamental aspect of health and hygiene that should be accessible to all individuals, regardless of gender identity. Our products and messaging are designed to be inclusive and respectful of diverse identities and experiences. We strive to create a welcoming and affirming environment for everyone who menstruates or supports those who do.</p>
