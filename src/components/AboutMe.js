              <p> Hi, I’m Samantha, and like a lot of people who menstruate, I received sub-par education on how to handle it. Growing up in a rural, conservative area, our reproductive health lesson was in 5th or 6th grade. This consisted of two videos, one on female anatomy and one on male. They did not separate the class, and I don’t think my face has ever burned so bright then being eleven years old and sitting next to a boy while a diagram of a penis lit up the far from flat-screened rolling TV. After the videos, the girls got “goodie-bags” of pads and liners and we were sent to our next class. These bags were quickly tossed in lockers and never talked about again. </p>
              <p>This shame and embarrassment would follow me through life. From trying to buy pads with my single father, who was not knowledgeable on the matter at all, or from asking some of my girl friends how to use a tampon in high school so I could swim in P.E. Tampons were tucked up sleeves. Pads were hidden in binder covers. No one would ever try to educate me further than that one lesson in middle school.  </p>
              <p>I was in college the next time I really thought about my period. I was taking an environmental ethics class, and we were prompted to pick a sustainable habit and follow through with it for a month, then write a paper about how it affected us. I gave up single-use plastics. I brought my own tupperware instead of to-go boxes. I carried around straws and utensils. I thought I was killing it - and then I got my period. I went to the bathroom to greet Aunt Flo, and the only things I had for her visit were the cotton tampons with single use applicators wrapped in plastic or pads in the exact same condition.  </p>
              <p>Here was this lifestyle change that I had been incredibly conscious about staring me in the face asking “what are you going to do now?” So I bought a menstrual cup. And I unboxed it and it didn’t come with directions or warnings or any of the things that tampons did. It was uncomfortable and I was uncomfortable. I read a horror story online that it could suction out my IUD and I promptly threw the cup away.  </p>
              <p>A few months ago, I tried the cup again. And again, I was met with little direction about how to pick a size besides “have birthed children” and “has not birthed children.” There also wasn’t a lot in the box about insertion, or about risks. So then I wondered, can I get Toxic Shock from this like a tampon? How long can I safely leave this in for?  </p>
              <p>Riddled with questions I did what anyone would do - I went to Google. Unfortunately, Google did not have much to say. I figured everyone would have these questions, and maybe they did but no one was answering them. So I set off on a journey to find the answers I was seeking. I found that and even more. Now, I am happy to be able to share what I learned. I’m hoping that moving forward, you and I both, dear reader, can Bleed Sustainably. </p>
